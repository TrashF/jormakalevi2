Simple and extendable PHP Mongo document system

I've used this as a base for a few projects and thought I decided to separate this as a stand-alone 
component to ease my own project maintenance. It contains a Document class which should be used as a 
base for custom models and a simple User class that provides very basic authentication features and 
class based CRUD permission system.

This is version 2 of the library and uses currently suggested MongoDB driver. In case you need to use 
legacy Mongo driver, check out version 1 of project at https://github.com/TrashF/jormakalevi
